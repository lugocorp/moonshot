## Moonshot Website Todo List
- [ ] Change LUA Redefined to Lua Redefined, and align it to the left
- [ ] Remove SPLASH / EXAMPLES from above the CodeMirror div
- [ ] Decrease the size of Home, Reference and Install in the navbar
- [ ] Center the links in the footer
- [ ] Add horizontal padding to the 3 white feature divs and center the text
- [ ] Make it so that the moons in the features section can be at most 60% of the width of their container, and center them
- [ ] Remove left padding from the paragraph in Getting Started section, so they line up with the Getting Started title
- [ ] Add some padding at the bottom of the Getting Started section
- [ ] Change the CodeMirror content to this:

```
class MoonShot extends Lua where

  function getNewFeatures()
    -- Adds OOP and optional typing
  end

  function compile()
    -- Runs compile-time safety checks
  end

end
```
