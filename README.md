# Moonshot

**version** 0.9.0 (beta)

Moonshot is an optionally-typed object-oriented extension language for Lua. This project allows you to use your favorite Lua libraries and frameworks with a more organized and error-safe code base. Moonshot is lightweight, and doesn't weigh down on your runtime. It gives you full interop with vanilla Lua as well as a fully developed optional typing system.
