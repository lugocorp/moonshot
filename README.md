## Moonshot Website Todo List
- [ ] Make the navbar links a bit smaller (75% as large as they are now)
- [ ] Change the GitHub logo background to be Lua's dark blue color, not black
- [ ] Lowercase every header, only capitalize the first letter of each word
- [ ] Replace the moon in the navbar with res/moonshot.svg
- [ ] Move Get Started to be left aligned
- [ ] Change Lua Defined to Lua Redefined
- [ ] Double the padding on the sides of the screen (so text isn't so close to the edge)
- [ ] Remove the whitespace below the footer
- [ ] The entire footer should be black
- [ ] Give cursor:pointer; to the GitHub icons' CSS
- [ ] Halve the vertical padding on the header
- [ ] Fix the CodeMirror import paths (shouldn't start with ../ because the codemirror folder is on the same level as index.html)
