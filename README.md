## Moonshot Website Todo List
- [1] Make the navbar links a bit smaller (75% as large as they are now)
- [0] Change the GitHub logo background to be Lua's dark blue color, not black
- [1] Lowercase every header, only capitalize the first letter of each word
- [1] Replace the moon in the navbar with res/moonshot.svg
- [1] Move Get Started to be left aligned
- [1] Change Lua Defined to Lua Redefined
- [1] Double the padding on the sides of the screen (so text isn't so close to the edge)
- [1] Remove the whitespace below the footer
- [1] The entire footer should be black
- [1] Give cursor:pointer; to the GitHub icons' CSS
- [1] Halve the vertical padding on the header
- [1] Fix the CodeMirror import paths (shouldn't start with ../ because the codemirror folder is on the same level as index.html)

I used binary 1- for completed task 0- not completed.
